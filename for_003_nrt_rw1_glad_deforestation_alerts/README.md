## GLAD Deforestation Alerts Dataset Near Real-time Script
This file describes the near real-time script that retrieves and processes the [the Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) Alert](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034008) for [display on Resource Watch](http://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/6ec78a52-3fb2-478f-a02b-abafa5328244).

The source provided the data as an image collection on Google Earth Engine. Each day of data was split into five images of different regions.

For each day, the data from the five different regions is mosaicked to create a global dataset for display on Resource Watch.

Please see the [Python script](https://github.com/resource-watch/nrt-scripts/blob/master/for_003_nrt_rw1_glad_deforestation_alerts/contents/src/__init__.py) for more details on this processing.

You can view the processed GLAD Deforestation Alerts dataset [on Resource Watch](http://resourcewatch.org/data/explore/6ec78a52-3fb2-478f-a02b-abafa5328244).

You can also download the original dataset [from the source website](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/3/034008).
